# Indoor-UAV
Repo for the indoor UAV project for warehouse inventory management. The project is supervised by Mr Kaushal Kishore of the Intelligent Systems Group at CSIR-CEERI Pilani.

I will be working on the local planning problem so that the UAV can be enabled to navigate in an evironment containing dynamic obstacles.
