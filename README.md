# Indoor-UAV
Repo for the indoor UAV project for warehouse inventory management. The project is supervised by Mr Kaushal Kishore of the Intelligent Systems Group at CSIR-CEERI Pilani.

I will be working on the local planning problem so that the UAV can be enabled to navigate in an evironment containing dynamic obstacles.

FASTPlanner seems to be very famous. But will need to think of some modifications or something new. Basically 4 mahine kaam karaychay tar kahitari pahije...
